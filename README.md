 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer IT student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself android development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Python. A desire that burns inside me sense graduation as full-stack software engineering . However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - logo/web designs creation. I eventually ended up building and designing websites for clients as a freelancer as a full-time after  graduation, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a freelancer. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a website or design a logo than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product and to take on hard developping tasks. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2024 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2023. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
